## neovim

- [ ] redo without LazyVim, build yourself from scratch
- [ ] add obsidian
- [ ] add beancount

## tmux

- [ ] let tmux move into the background, use less leaderkey bindings, try to put the important stuff behind <C-...> shortcuts
- [ ] smart session manager should at least allow all repos under ~, maybe also every dir entered via zoxide, maybe create a new session from a command
- [ ] have a standardized window manager

## build

- [ ] try nix, probably only use it for basic bootstrap. I don't want a nix lock in. I'm also not interested in 100% reproducible builds, I just want that everything I need is setup in one go - no stupid surprises.
- [ ] try ansible
